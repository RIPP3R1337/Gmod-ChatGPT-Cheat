How to use:

1. Place in `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua`
2. Lenny's script provided us with a beautiful website: [Garry's mod server list with sv_allowslua allowed](https://www.gametracker.com/search/garrysmod/?search_by=server_variable&search_by2=sv_allowcslua&query=&loc=_all&sort=&order=) << BE AWARE, some servers might give false-positives. So expect lua to not work on certain servers.
