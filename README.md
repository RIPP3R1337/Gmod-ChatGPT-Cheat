A simple and lightweight cheat for Garry's Mod made with ChatGPT with features like ESP, Aimbot. Built to enhance gameplay while keeping it undetectable (not really).

 **I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, BANS OR ANYTHING RELATED TO THIS CHEAT. You're downloading and using this at your own risk**

# How to use:

1. Place gmod.lua in `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua`
2. Lenny's script provided us with a beautiful website: [Garry's mod server list with sv_allowslua allowed](https://www.gametracker.com/search/garrysmod/?search_by=server_variable&search_by2=sv_allowcslua&query=&loc=_all&sort=&order=) 
3. Put in **Server variable** "1" It wont be a lot of servers but there's still a few with lua enabled.
